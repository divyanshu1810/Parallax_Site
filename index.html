        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different
            speed than the foreground content while scrolling. <br><br> Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer
            graphics where background images move past the camera more
            slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique
            grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.
            Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics with its introduction to video games in the early
            1980s. Some parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game Jump Bug (1981).It used a limited form
            of parallax scrolling with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move
            slowly, adding depth to the scenery. The following year, Moon Patrol (1982) implemented a full form of
            parallax scrolling, with three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the
            distance between them. Moon Patrol is often credited with popularizing parallax scrolling. Jungle
            King (1982), later called Jungle Hunt, also had parallax scrolling, and was released a month after Moon
            Patrol in June 1982 <br><br>
            Some display systems support multiple background layers that can be scrolled independently in horizontal and
            vertical directions and composited on one another, simulating a multiplane camera. On such a display system,
            a game can produce parallax by simply changing each layer's position by a different amount in the same
            direction. Layers that move more quickly are perceived to be closer to the virtual camera. Layers can be
            placed in front of the playfield—the layer containing the objects with which the player interacts—for
            various reasons such as to provide increased dimension, obscure some of the action of the game, or distract
            the player. <br><br>
            Programmers may also make pseudo-layers of sprites—individually controllable moving objects drawn by
            hardware on top of or behind the layers—if they are available on the display system. For instance Star
            Force, an overhead-view vertically scrolling shooter for NES, used this for its starfield, and Final Fight
            for the Super NES used this technique for the layer immediately in front of the main playfield.
            The Amiga computer has sprites which can have any height and can be set horizontal with the copper
            co-processor, which makes them ideal for this purpose. <br><br>
            Risky Woods on the Amiga uses sprites multiplexed with the copper to create an entire fullscreen parallax
            background layer as an alternative to the system's dual playfield mode. <br><br>
            Scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to 'float' over a repeating background layer by
            animating the individual tiles' bitmaps in order to portray the parallax effect. Color cycling can be used
            to animate tiles quickly on the whole screen. This software effect gives the illusion of another (hardware)
            layer. Many games used this technique for a scrolling star-field, but sometimes a more intricate or
            multi-directional effect is achieved, such as in the game Parallax by Sensible Software.</p>
